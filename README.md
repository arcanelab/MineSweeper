This is a Minesweeper clone written in C++ using SDL2.

In order to be able to compile, you'll need `SDL2` and `SDL2_image` libraries to be installed.

How to compile on OS X:

- (optional) Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

    `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

- `brew install sdl2`

- `brew install sdl2_image`

- `make`
